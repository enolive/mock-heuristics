# My Mock Heuristics

A little presentation I made about my mocking heuristics
I've already discussed at my [blog](http://www.welcz.de/blog/2016/06/22/my-heuristics-for-working-with-mocks/).

It is based on the wonderful reveal.js framework. Grab your copy [here](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/)!

You might also want to take a look at [mock-heuristics.md](mock-heuristics.md) which is essentially the markdown version of the whole 
presentation.
